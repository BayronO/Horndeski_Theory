# Horndeski Theory
First order cosmological perturbations of the Horndeski theory.

We consider Horndeski theory in perturbed flat FLRW in the Newtonian gauge. The perturbations are computed using the xPand package of Mathematica. Our calculations are compared with [1904.06294 [astro-ph.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06294), finding good agreement with the expressions there. 

In the notebook "Horndeski_Theory.nb" you will find:

1) First order cosmological perturbations for the Horndeski theory respecting the GW170817 constraint on the speed of gravitational waves.
2) An effective fluid description of the Horndeski theory. Expressions for the background and perturbed fluid properties (density, pressure, velocity, anisotropic stress) are provided.
3) Some examples where specific models within the Horndeski theory are worked out.

In the notebook "EFA_Horndeski.nb" you will find analytical expressions for the perturbations of dark energy in Horndeski theories. Under the quasi-static and sub-horizon approximations, we provide formulae for the density perturbation, pressure perturbation, scalar velocity, anisotropic stress. We also get the perturbations of the scalar field and the gravitational potentials, from which we compute the strength gravitational parameters Geff and Qeff, and also the slip parameters. We compare our results with [1904.06294 [astro-ph.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06294) and find some discrepancies in the way the quasi-static and the sub-horizon approximations were applied. Our approach yields directly to well-known results as can be seen in the "Examples" section.
