# Horndeski Theory
First order cosmological perturbations of the Horndeski theory.

We consider Horndeski theory in perturbed flat FLRW. The perturbations are computed using the xPand package of Mathematica. Our calculations are compared with [1904.06294 [astro-ph.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06294), finding good agreement with the expressions there. 

In the notebook "Horndeski_Theory.nb" you will find:

1) First order cosmological perturbations for the Horndeski theory respecting the GW170817 constraint on the speed of gravitational waves.
2) An effective fluid description of the Horndeski theory. Expressions for the background and perturbed fluid properties (density, pressure, velocity, anisotropic stress) are provided.
3) Some examples where specific models within the Horndeski theory are worked out.
